          <div className="ownerContent">Bake House, established in 1969 by Swedish immigrant Maria Andersson, 
            began with family recipes and a small brick oven. Maria's delicious rye bread and cardamom pastries 
            quickly made the bakery a community favorite. The first official franchise was opened in Connought 
            Place. Passed down through generations, the bakery still honors 
            its traditional roots while delighting customers with both classic and new treats, maintaining a legacy 
            of artisanal baking.</div>
